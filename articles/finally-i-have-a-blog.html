        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, welcome to my first blog post. I hope you share the same excitement reading this post as I do writing it.
            If you don't know a lot about me I am a passionate software developer who tries to learn something new every day.
            I have been thinking about starting a blog for a while now and I finally decided to take the plunge and start one.
            Since this is my first blog post I thought it would be a good idea to write about how I finally have a blog.
            Therefore, this post will outline <strong>why</strong> and <strong>how</strong> to start blogging so that you can also start your own blog.
        </p>
        <h2> Why You Should Care </h2>
        <p>
            One of the reasons to start blogging has to be to share your knowledge with the world. You might have a unique perspective on a topic that you want to share with the world.
            When I was developing my <a href="/projects.html">game engine Nyxis</a> I spent a tremendous amount of time searching for solutions to problems that I encountered.
            Unfortunately, since Vulkan is a relatively new API there were not a lot of resources available. I had to read the Vulkan specification and the source code of other projects to understand how to use Vulkan.
            So I was left with reading the documentation of low level functions and trying to decipher the "correct" way to do stuff.
            Of course one might call this inabilty skill issues, but let's not get carried away.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another reason is that I believe that going back to the basics of what you learn is a good way to progresss into the future.
            I have been programming for a while now and I have learned a lot of things.
            However, I have never really taken the time to write about what I have learned.
            I believe that writing about what you have learned is a good way to reinforce what you have learned.
            I should think we will find out if this is true as I continue to write blog posts.
        </p>

        <h2> How to Start Blogging </h2>
        <p>
            Now that we are done with the boring(idon'tthinkitwasboring) stuff, let's get to the fun part. How do you start a blog?
            As you might've guessed, there is no one way to start writing. Everybody has their own tastes and preferences.
            You might just start writing you markdown files and host them on a server. Or you might use a blogging platform like WordPress or Medium.
            However, since I am a computer engineer who likes to flex in every given opportunty and very passionate about my environment and products, I decided to take thing to the next level.
            I decided to build my own blog from scratch. I wanted to have full control over my blog and I wanted to learn something new.
            The essential requirements for my blog were:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It should be fast</li>
            <li>It should be easy to use</li>
            <li>It should be easy to maintain</li>
            <li>It should be easy to deploy</li>
            <li>It should be easy to customize</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These requirements are not exhaustive but they are the most important to me.
            If you have done some web development before you might have guessed that I decided to use a static site generator.
            I decided to use <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> as my static site generator. Nah I am just kidding, I decided to build my own static site generator.
            But that is a topic for another blog post.
